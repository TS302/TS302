# Hi, I'm Tom

Iâ€™m a **Junior App Developer** with a strong focus on **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** and modern cross-platform development.  
In early 2024, I successfully completed my training as a Junior App Developer at **Syntax Institute** and have since been expanding my knowledge in the **Appvanced Experts Program**, with a particular emphasis on **Kotlin Multiplatform**.  

ðŸ’¡ My passion lies in designing **clean, scalable architectures** and connecting shared business logic with user-friendly UIs for **Android (Jetpack Compose)** and **iOS (SwiftUI)**. I combine a solid foundation in app development with hands-on experience in current technologies such as **KMP, Ktor, Koin, Coroutines, and Firebase (Firestore & Authentication)**.  

âœ¨ I am highly motivated to keep learning, adapt quickly to new challenges, and contribute actively to team success. My goal is always to create applications that are not only functional but also efficient and enjoyable to use.
